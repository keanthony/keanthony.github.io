            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>I am a Software Development Major at Georgia Gwinnett College. I
                plan to graduate in May 2016.
                I work as an ITEC tutor in the Academic Enhancement Center.
                I enjoy peer tutoring all ITEC subjects and Discrete Math.  
                My hobbies include building computers and spending time with my 
                son.  I enjoy exercising, being outdoors, going on adventures,
                and staying healthy. I enjoy outdoor activities including 
                biking, hiking, rafting, swimming, and canoeing. I place a lot 
                of emphasis on spending time with my family.  I volunteer my 
                time to the Running Club and Coding Club at my son's school.
                I plan to continue all of these activities in the future.
